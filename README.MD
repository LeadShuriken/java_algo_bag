# JAVA-ALGO-BAG

## Description

JAVA ALGO BAG is an exploration into algorithms and slim data structure runtime and general comparison of techniques used to sort, search, union, reverse, traverse (aka the drill). This repo is heavily influenced by Princeton University [Algorithms 1] and Princeton University [Algorithms 2]. Take the courses, buy the book, go faster through it if you're advanced. Absolutely worth the while.

## Technologies

JAVA-ALGO-BAG uses a number of open source projects:

  * [JAVA6] - JAVA 6 SDK OR HIGHER

## Content

 * Data Structures - Reduced versions of Stack and Queue implemented with Linked List and Array
 * Search - Common Searching Algorithms
 * Service - Test/Comparison Runner
 * Sort - Common Sorting Algorithms
 * Sum To - Advanced take on the ThreeSum problem
 * Union Find - Common Union(Connect) and Find(Is Connected) Algorithms
 * Utils - Helper Classes and such

## Todo

  - Integrate in TSA and TSF to find outliers.
